# Home Base

Stop Cop City links and resources are everywhere and, intentionally so, decentralized. This site is one of hopefully many efforts to make all of these resources more easily accessible and cross-referencable so that anyone who wants to learn about the Stop Cop City movement and its history can!

The website is structured like so:
- [General Sites](/general-sites)
- [Resources](/resources)
- [Reportbacks](/reportbacks)
- [Analyses and History](/analyses-and-history)
- [Socials](/socials)
